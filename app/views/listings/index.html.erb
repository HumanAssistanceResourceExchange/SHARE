<!--
This is the page where all of the listings will be shown. To style all the listings, you only need to add HTML for a single listing, and then I'll add code that makes that HTML repeat for every listing in the database.

This view should not have the listing creator's contact info or the "Make Request" button. A user should click on the listing to be taken to a detailed view of that listing. That page will be the "listings/show.html.erb" file. Inside that detailed view is where the "Make Request" button should go.
